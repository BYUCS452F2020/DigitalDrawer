I think DigitalDrawer is a great idea that would be very useful to keep track of content for later use. This could also help users keep content they have already seen for future use: for example, reaction memes. I could see myself using this for trivial content (memes) and more serious content (research papers I want to read). I am willing to help in planning and in all parts of development, both back-end and front-end. I have experience in front-end web development and a bit of experience using DynamoDB, but I am willing to work on any part of the system as needed.
