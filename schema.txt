Normalization Evidence: The table represents one entity: user credentials. Both the password chosen by the user and the salt chosen by the system depend on the username: passwords and salts can be repeated, while the username is unique. This table also has to be separate from the user table because it is sensitive information that the system should have access to, not employees.
Columns:

	Salt: Salt for the user password hash.
    
Payment(PaymentID, UserID, PaymentType, CardNumber)

Relationship To Other Tables: User has Payment
Normalization Evidence: The table represents one entity: user payment information. All collumns depend on PaymentID, including UserID, since users can have multiple payments, but a payment is unique and has one user. This table also has to be separate from the user table because it is sensitive information. Only employees that need the information, for tasks such as correcting payment information at the request of a user, should be able to access it.
Columns:
	PaymentID: Unique identifer for a payment
	UserID: Unique identifer referencing a user.
